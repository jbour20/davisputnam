### Davis-Putnam

The goal of this project is to produce a solution to a simple form of adventure game using the Davis-Putnam algorithm. To compile:  

`javac -d bin src/*.java`

To run:  

`java -cp bin Main file [-s]`

Input file must be provided as a command-line argument. All files generated by my solution are written to the outputs folder. Running the program with the optional `-s` flag will produce an additional file with clauses in symbolic form.  

Input must be formatted as follows (see `inputs`):  
- First line: space-separated list of nodes.
- Second line: space-separated list of treasures.
- Third line: number of allowed steps.
- Remaining lines: maze encoding.  

Sample board, corresponding to included input:
