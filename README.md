### Davis-Putnam

The goal of this project is to produce a solution to a simple form of adventure game using the Davis-Putnam algorithm. To compile:  

`javac -d bin src/*.java`

To run:  

`java -cp bin Main file [-s]`

Input file must be provided as a command-line argument. All files generated by my solution are written to the outputs folder. Running the program with the optional `-s` flag will produce an additional file with clauses in symbolic form.
